                    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>&nbsp;The Non-Aligned Movement: India&rsquo;s Advantage?&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Prithaa More</strong></p>
<p>The Non-Aligned Movement was first convened in 1955, in Bandung, Indonesia. It was built on principles of: respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states; rejection of the possibility of an unlawful regime change; each state&rsquo;s right to determine its own political and economic systems and refusal to use force or any unilateral economic, political, or military measures. The movement, as it had started out, advocated for a middle course for states in the developing world to perhaps spare them unnecessary burdens. Its founding leaders included Jawaharlal Nehru of India, Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia, Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, Sukarno of Indonesia, and Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a young nation, fresh on its heels, India&rsquo;s foreign policy was understandably delicate. With a new diplomatic identity,&nbsp; India had not yet made its international foothold as known as it would have liked. Its attempt to play an important role in the 1950&rsquo;s did not go unnoticed. India endeavoured to overcome its weaknesses and lack of recognition by mobilising developing African and Asian nations and assuming leadership of a non-aligned &lsquo;bloc&rsquo;. Prominent nations such as the United States viewed this as an attempt to create an additional global force. One could argue that the decision to remain firm in its non-alignment, positioned India as having a firm stance on its own ideals. Some were also quick to criticise the policy saying that it was too idealistic and lacked the decisiveness often needed in international politics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What the Non-Aligned Movement did benefit India with was in enhancing its room for manoeuvre in international affairs during the period of the Cold War. Many other newly independent countries were able to avoid being a part of either politico-military blocs (US-led NATO and USSR led Warsaw Pact) and be put in a situation where they could not exercise their own country&rsquo;s ideals before the pacts. With a growing number of participants, non-aligned countries could find strength in their numbers and use it to avoid being pressured by either super-power led bloc. Although in some instances non-aligned countries have chosen to align more closely with powers from each bloc at times, such as during the Indo-Soviet Treaty of Friendship in 1971.&nbsp;</p>
<p>India&rsquo;s position as a non-aligned country perhaps emulated its geographical position as a bridge between the East and the West. Many also consider the idea of non-alignment to reflect a position of neutrality. But its intention was not to reflect neutrality as much as it was to not be subservient to any country and maintain India&rsquo;s self intelligence. With the right to pass judgement on international issues the country deemed worthwhile, India&rsquo;s alignment was more towards its own independence than projecting neutrality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To this day, the Non-Aligned Movement continues as an international organisation.At present, the Movement boasts of 120 member states, 17 observer countries, and 10 observer organisations. India is still an active part of its delegation, but some are of the opinion that its relevance is diminishing. With a different world order emerging where China is a major contender to the US, and Russia and India&rsquo;s growing essentiality in being an ally to the US in the East, the common proclamation states India as a natural ally to the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the aftermath of such opinions, should the Non-Aligned Movement have been buried in the aftermath of the Cold War, at least for India?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, it seems like a new kind of nonalignment theory is emerging, forecasted as &ldquo;Nonalignment 2.0&rdquo;. In a multi ethnic democracy, India&rsquo;s success in creating intersectional policies with inputs from different governments, communities, and even corporations so as to further its own interests defines its future possibilities. The spirit of the thoughts on new nonalignment is backed by pragmatism. A cut throat world, advocates hope for India to pursue its own interests and leverage the competition amongst superpowers to the most of the nation&rsquo;s advantage.</p>
