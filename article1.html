                    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Whispers of Peril: Navigating Through the Raging Protests in Israel&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Satvik Dev&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a world characterised by polarisation, consisting of nations struggling with heightened uncertainties about their future, the unsettling circumstances brewing up in the state of Israel continue to exacerbate the predicament. Besides being infamous and frequently denounced for its illegal occupation of the Palestinian West Bank, the Israeli government in contemporary times is under fire from its own citizenry as mass protests and demonstrations rock the country altogether. The recently initiated historic march of the protesting activists from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem (Mcneil), underscores the urgency of comprehending the entire issue triggering this mass mobilisation and especially its possible implications on foreign reactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While numerous motivations seem to drive this anti-government parade, the chief cause continues to be the passing of a controversial judicial reform law by the far-right regime of Prime Minister Netanyahu. The nation of Israel which emerged in the post WWII setting, lacked the privilege of time and political bandwidth to put forth the ample liberal guardrails necessary for the sustenance of democracy. In the absence of a clearly defined constitution, the judiciary there, for decades, has been an institution entrusted with the responsibility of protecting the rights of the common folk (TLDR News Global). Adhering to certain &lsquo;Basic Laws&rsquo; which together constitute the foundational principles of the state, the judiciary ensures an active check on the laws passed by the Parliament i.e., the Knesset. Owing to this, the government and the Supreme Court on several instances have been in a tussle with each other contending over authority.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The recent bill proposed by Netanyahu in such a landscape, conveys the executive&rsquo;s resolve to end this tension in their favour. Through judicial reform, the government aims to catalyse radical changes in the realm of law making. It aims to assign more power to the Knesset regarding the appointment of the Supreme Court judges who were earlier appointed by a panel of senior supreme court judges and lawyers from the Bar Association. Furthermore, it shall curtail the power of the judiciary in striking down laws concerning the domain of National Security. Notably, it also harbours an override clause whereby a government possessing a simple majority in the Knesset, would be allowed to overrule the decision of the Supreme Court concerning the striking down of a law which the court deems unreasonable and this in turn, would absolve the ministers from the obligation to follow the directions of their legal advisors guided by&nbsp; attorney general (Berg).&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thus, this landmark bill promises a comprehensive overhaul of the Israeli judiciary. Under the veil of transferring excessive power from the unelected Supreme Court Judges to elected officials of the state, many view it as a calculated manoeuvre undertaken by Prime Minister Netanyahu to consolidate power in his own hands and within his party which commands a simple majority in the Parliament. Hence, consequently they fear a collapse of the democratic apparatus of the state. The response to this has been tumultuous to say the least. The active support of former Prime ministers like Ehud Olmert and Yair Lapid and opposition leaders towards this protest for democracy in current times has only flared up the popular discontent to its boiling point. Even as the bill was on hold for several weeks, there was a seething anger amongst people against the regime for the punitive measures that were employed to suppress demonstrations and now that it has been passed, the stage is set for a profound crisis. In light of such developments therefore, it would be interesting to observe and chart out the implications of these circumstances on foreign relations of Israel with other nations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An interesting case is elicited by the United States where the Biden Administration has repeatedly expressed serious concerns over the growing civil unrest in Israel. Protests in Israel inarguably pose a serious diplomatic challenge to the United States which happens to be a key ally and supplier in terms of military assistance to Israel. With a band of progressive democrats and Jewish groups pressuring the President at home to condemn and take actions against the Israeli leadership, tensions may simmer if the US makes attempts to intervene in the internal matters of Israel. It is evident from the approach as in how President Biden despite witnessing the dramatic line of protests raging across the polity in France remained relatively silent on the issue but went on to lecture Netanyahu on democratic values while urging him to ensure a consensus on the judicial overhaul plan (Magid).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Owing to the obstinacy of the latter in continually pushing for such a reform and the far-right illiberal character of his present regime, such protests could in fact result in reduced support from Israel&rsquo;s own allies at the international forum. The presence of a security risk further gets exacerbated in such a vulnerable time which may result in the authorities ramping up violence against the revolting citizens. In a bid to shift the public attention towards a unifying cause, the government can in fact initiate unchecked strikes against the Palestinian Armed groups further endangering human life in the region.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Serious questions and ramifications extend to the domain of international trade as well. An escalation of such protests may have far-reaching consequences on the Israeli economy. Labour unions and business leaders going on an indefinite strike shall not only culminate into the disruption of the regional supply-chains but to a potential national shut-down. Such a situation is certainly worrisome as besides recession, political instability coupled with an inefficient judicial apparatus can severely hamper the image of the state. Along with a subsequent dwindling of the capital inflow, repercussions shall involve a major hit to Israel&rsquo;s status as a conducive space for emerging start-ups. In a nutshell, the ongoing protests and the passing of the Judicial Reform Law has plunged Israel into a complex and volatile situation that demands a close observation and attention on part of the international community.</p>
